						Cooking is difficult and MILF understands that. We are a group of like-minded individuals united through food. We aim to 
						spread the joys of comfort foods from all backgrounds, because food sees no differences. This website is designed to be a one-stop 
						website to help you serve hearty and delicious meals, with recipes and clear instructions. Better yet, the development of 
						this website is to help those who do not have the knowledge or time to cook cheap, easy-to-make, and healthy meals. We wish to encourage others 
						to eat healthier and treat their body well amidst their hectic schedules. We hope that through this website, we will prove that healthy 
						eating can be done and be equally as flavorful as the unhealthy options.
